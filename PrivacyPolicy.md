# Call Notifier Privacy Policy
-----------------------------------------

Call Notifier is an smartphone application that notifies a server when you (as a user) receive a phone call or a text message. You choose if you want to be notified for phone calls and/or text messages.
These notifications are sent to the server you specified and nowhere else.

## Phone calls notifications
Notifications contain two data:
  - Caller phone number
  - Caller username

Call Notifier looks up for caller username in the smartphone addressbook using the phone number. If no match is found, the username will be empty.

## Text messages notifications
Notifications contain three data:
  - Sender phone number
  - Sender username
  - Text message content

Call Notifier looks up for sender username in the smartphone addressbook using the phone number. If no match is found, the username will be empty.
